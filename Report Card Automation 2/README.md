## General info
This project generates report cards of all students by running .exe file. The idea is to replicate [this](https://www.mathsolympiad.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ESR-Sample.pdf) till Section 2. As an input we need an excel file in which result of students is present and pics of all students and both the files by default is available in this prject (You can replace it with your one). By running pdfGenerator.exe file, in few seconds you will notice that Pdfs are being generated as per the information.

* Python 2.7 : Source Code is written in Python language.
