1> Run the "pdfGenerator" exe file.

2> Be patient and wait for few seconds pdfs will begin to appear one by one.

3> To make user interface simpler I am not taking any input from user while running my .exe file (But that is trivial and can be achieved if required) and I kept all the pics at the same folder for the same reason.

4> There were few spelling mistakes in your Excel file and I have corrected those . Apart from that percentile data was missing , so I have added it also.

5> I hope you will like my hard work.


6> Thank you sir.
